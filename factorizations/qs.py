# General Number sieve is far more complex but the best prime factoring method
# Quadratic Sieve Factorization is 2nd best

# For factoring numbers less than 100 digits

# 1. Finding B-smooth numbers
# 2. Solve kernels of a matrix.
    # To find the kernel of a matrix A is the same as to solve the system AX = 0
